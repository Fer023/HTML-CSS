    <h1>I see that you are a curious little fella huh?</h1>
    <p>This page is exclusively to type random words in english in order to complete a challenge proposed by teacher Guanabara so I can fully develop my web programming skills. I must use all the knowledge he gave me thus far... </p>

    <p><u>You didn't think I was being honest, did you?</u></p>
    <p>NSA is watching me as I type this website information.< Eventually they will have access to all my thoughts. I hope the chaos and disorder of my mind fry their computers so they never again seek me</p>
    <h1>BUT, BEFORE YOU LEAVE</h1>
    <p>Have you ever wondered if humanity will be replaced? To be honest, I wish aliens would come and wipe out all humans  but preserve our conscience so they can bestow it upon bodies made of steel, thus creating a mechanical nightmarish race</p>
